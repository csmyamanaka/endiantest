Description:
============
Originally, this project was just a quick test used in another project (namely "File IO ++" or "fileiopp")
because it was necessary for me to know how data is stored on my compiler because I was reading and writing byte data from files.
Although it's a very small and simple test, I figured it could eventually become useful for other projects as well so I made it into its own repo.

Installation:
=============
Just use make
  
  make

Usage:
======
After it's been compiled, just run it:

  ./EndianTest


Uninstall:
==========
  
  make clean
